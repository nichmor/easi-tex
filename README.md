# create and activate the conda environment
conda create -n easitex python=3.10
conda activate easitex

# install PyTorch 2.0.1
conda install pytorch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

Then, install PyTorch3D:

```shell
# install runtime dependencies for PyTorch3D
conda install -c fvcore -c iopath -c conda-forge fvcore iopath
conda install -c bottler nvidiacub

# install PyTorch3D
conda install pytorch3d -c pytorch3d
```

Install `xformers` to accelerate transformers:

```shell
# please don't use pip to install it, as it only supports PyTorch>=2.0
conda install xformers -c xformers
```

Install the necessary packages listed out in requirements.txt:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
